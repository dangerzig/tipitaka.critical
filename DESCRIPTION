Description: A lemmatized critical edition of the complete Pali Canon
    (Tipitaka), the canonical scripture of Theravadin Buddhism. Based
    on a five-witness collation of PTS (via GRETIL), SuttaCentral,
    VRI (Chattha Sangayana), Buddha Jayanti Tipitaka, and the Thai
    Royal Edition. All text is lemmatized using the Digital Pali
    Dictionary, grouping inflected forms by dictionary headword.
    Covers all three pitakas (Sutta, Vinaya, Abhidhamma) with
    5,777 individual text units. The companion package 'tipitaka'
    provides the original VRI edition data and Pali text tools.
